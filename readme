* password : your password
* hidden : list of names that you don't wnat to watch his/her posts :)
* group_predicates : set of predicates that define 'group'
    For example, if you want a group that contains all the posts, add
      "all":(lambda status: True)
    to the set 'group_predicates'.
    or if you want to watch the post in reply to you, add
      "reply":(lambda status: "(@yourname)" in tagText(status, 'text'))

    'tw (YOUR TWEET HERE)'
* To change the group you see:
    'ch (GROUP NAME)'
* To quit:
    'q'
