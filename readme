'tw' is a tiny twitter client that works on your terminal

== CONFIGURE ==
* username : your account name
* password : your password

== COMMAND ==
* To post the tweet:
    'tw (YOUR TWEET HERE)'
* To change the group you see:
    'gr (GROUP NAME)'
    tw can complement (GROUP NAME) if the partial name isn't ambiguous.
* To change the account:
    'ac (account number)'
* To fetch the new tweets:
    'up'
* To see the old tweets:
    'log'
    When you type 'log', tw enters log-view mode.
    In this mode, tw behaves like unix command 'more'.
    Press enter key to see older tweets.
    Input number to chagne the number of tweets you want to see at one time.
* To quit:
    'q'
