'tw' is a tiny twitter client that works on your terminal

== CONFIGURE ==
* username : your account name
* password : your password
* hidden : list of names whose tweets you don't want to see :)
* group_predicates : set of predicates that define 'group'    
    These predicates take 'tweet' and should return boolean value.
    'tweet' is a dictionary data and its keys are:
    id, screen_name, text, created_at and user_id.
    The key 'text' is the main contents of the tweet.

    For example, if you want a group that contains all the posts, add
      "all":(lambda tweet: True)
    to the set 'group_predicates'.
    or if you want to watch the post refering you, add
      "reply":(lambda tweet: "(@yourname)" in tweet["text"])

== COMMAND ==
* To post the tweet:
    'tw (YOUR TWEET HERE)'
* To change the group you see:
    'gr (GROUP NAME)'
    tw can complement (GROUP NAME) if the partial name isn't ambiguous.
* To change the account:
    'ac (account number)'
* To fetch the new tweets:
    'up'
* To see the old tweets:
    'log'
    When you type 'log', tw enters log-view mode.
    In this mode, tw behaves like unix command 'more'.
    Press enter key to see older tweets.
    Input number to chagne the number of tweets you want to see at one time.
* To quit:
    'q'
