'tw' is a tiny twitter client that works on a shell.

username : your account name
password : your password
hidden : list of names that you don't wnat to watch his/her posts :)
group_predicates : set of predicates that define 'group'
  For example, if you want a group that contains all the posts, add
    "all":(lambda status: True)
  to the set 'group_predicates'.
  or if you want to watch the post in reply to you, add
    "reply":(lambda status: "(@yourname)" in tagText(status, 'text'))
